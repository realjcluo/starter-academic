abstract: Based on multidimensional health, we aimed to identify health groups
  among the elderly Chinese population, and examine its relationship with
  socio-demographic factors on healthcare utilization. Chinese Longitudinal
  Healthy Longevity Survey in 2014 was adopted. For 2981 participants aged ≥65
  years, without missing any health indicators, latent class analysis was
  adopted to identify health groups. For 1974 participants with complete
  information, the two-part model was used to assess how health groups and
  socio-demographic characteristics influence the outpatient and inpatient
  expenditure. Four health groups were identified and labeled as “Lacking
  Socialization” (10.4%), “High Comorbidity” (16.7%), “Severe Disability”
  (7.8%), and “Relative Health” (65.1%). Compared with the relative health
  group, the lacking socialization group cost higher inpatient expenditure (p =
  0.02). Those in the high comorbidity and severe disability groups were more
  likely to use healthcare services and cost higher outpatient expenditure (p <
  0.01 for all). The effects of socio-demographic factors were also discussed.
  The findings enhanced our understanding of the heterogeneity of
  multidimensional health status and complex healthcare demands in the elderly
  Chinese population. Moreover, it is valuable for improving the allocation of
  healthcare resource targeted for different groups of the ageing population.
