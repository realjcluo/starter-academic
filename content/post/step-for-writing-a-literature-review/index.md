## Step 1: Search for relevant literature

A clearly defined [topic](https://www.scribbr.com/research-process/dissertation-topics/).

### Make a list of keywords

### Search for relevant sources

Some useful **databases** to search for journals and articles include:

* Your university’s library catalogue
* [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/)
* [JSTOR](https://www.jstor.org/)
* [EBSCO](https://www.ebsco.com/products/research-databases)
* [Project Muse](http://muse.jhu.edu/) (humanities and social sciences)
* [Medline](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/medline.html) (life sciences and biomedicine)
* [EconLit](https://www.aeaweb.org/econlit/) (economics)
* [Inspec](https://www.theiet.org/publishing/inspec/) (physics, engineering and computer science)

**Boolean operators**: help narrow down search:

* **AND** to find sources that contain more than one keyword (e.g. social media AND body image AND generation Z)
* **OR** to find sources that contain one of a range of synonyms (e.g. generation Z OR teenagers OR adolescents)
* **NOT** to exclude results containing certain terms (e.g. apple NOT fruit)

## Step 2: Evaluate and select sources

For each publication, ask yourself:

* What **question or problem** is the author addressing?
* What are **the key concepts** and how are they defined?
* What are **the key theories, models and methods**? Does the research use **established frameworks** or take **an innovative approach**?
* What are **the results and conclusions** of the study?
* How does the publication **relate to other literature** in the field? Does it **confirm, add to, or challenge** established knowledge?
* How does the publication **contribute to your understanding of the topic**? What are its **key insights and arguments**?
* What are the **strengths and weaknesses** of the research?

Make sure the sources you use are [credible](https://www.scribbr.com/citing-sources/craap-test/), and make sure you read **any landmark studies and major theories** in your field of research.

You can find out how many times an article has been cited on Google Scholar – **a high citation count** means the article has been influential in the field, and should certainly be included in your literature review.

The scope of your review will depend on your topic and discipline: in the **sciences** you usually only review recent literature, but in the **humanities** you might take a long historical perspective (for example, to trace how a concept has changed in meaning over time).

### Take notes and cite your sources

It is important to keep track of your sources with [citations](https://www.scribbr.com/category/citing-sources/) to [avoid plagiarism](https://www.scribbr.com/category/plagiarism/). It can be helpful to make an [annotated bibliography](https://www.scribbr.com/chicago-style/annotated-bibliography/), where you compile full citation information and write a paragraph of [summary](https://www.scribbr.com/citing-sources/how-to-summarize/) and analysis for each source. This helps you remember what you read and saves time later in the process.

## Step 3: Identify themes, debates, and gaps

To begin organizing your literature review’s argument and structure, you need to understand the **connections and relationships between the sources** you’ve read. Based on your reading and notes, you can look for:

* **Trends and patterns (in theory, method or results):** do certain approaches become more or less popular over time?
* **Themes:** what questions or concepts recur across the literature?
* **Debates, conflicts and contradictions:** where do sources disagree?
* **Pivotal publications:** are there any influential theories or studies that changed the direction of the field?
* **Gaps:** what is missing from the literature? Are there weaknesses that need to be addressed?

This step will help you work out the structure of your literature review and (if applicable) show how your own research will contribute to existing knowledge.

## Step 4: Outline your literature review’s structure

There are various approaches to organizing the body of a literature review. You should have a rough idea of your **strategy** before you start writing.

Depending on the length of your literature review, you can combine several of these strategies (for example, your overall structure might be thematic, but each theme is discussed chronologically).

### Chronological

The simplest approach is to trace the development of the topic over time. However, if you choose this strategy, be careful to **avoid simply listing and summarizing sources in order**.

Try to analyze **patterns, turning points and key debates** that have shaped the direction of the field. Give your interpretation of **how and why certain developments occurred**.

### Thematic

If you have found some recurring central themes, you can organize your literature review into subsections that address different aspects of the topic.

### Methodological

If you draw your sources from different disciplines or fields that use a variety of [research methods](https://www.scribbr.com/category/methodology/), you might want to compare the **results and conclusions that emerge from different approaches**. For example:

* Look at what results have emerged in **[qualitative versus quantitative research](https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/qualitative-quantitative-research/)**
* Discuss how the topic has been approached by **empirical versus theoretical scholarship**
* Divide the literature into **sociological, historical, and cultural sources**

### Theoretical

A literature review is often the foundation for a [theoretical framework](https://www.scribbr.com/dissertation/theoretical-framework/). You can use it to discuss **various theories, models, and definitions of key concepts**.

You might argue for the relevance of a **specific** theoretical approach, or combine **various** theoretical concepts to create a **framework** for your research.

## Step 5: Write your literature review

Like any other [academic text](https://www.scribbr.com/category/academic-writing/), your literature review should have an **[introduction](https://www.scribbr.com/academic-essay/introduction/)**, a **main body**, and a **[conclusion](https://www.scribbr.com/academic-essay/conclusion/)**. What you include in each depends on the objective of your literature review.

### Introduction

The introduction should **clearly establish the focus and purpose of the literature review**.

> **Dissertation literature review**
> If you are writing the literature review as part of your dissertation or thesis, **reiterate your central problem or research question and give a brief summary of the scholarly context**. You can emphasize the **timeliness of the topic** (“many recent studies have focused on the problem of x”) or highlight **a gap in the literature** (“while there has been much research on x, few researchers have taken y into consideration”).
>
> **Stand-alone literature review**
> If you are writing a stand-alone paper, give **some background on the topic and its importance**, discuss **the scope of the literature** you will review (for example, the time period of your sources), and **state your objective**. What new insight will you draw from the literature?

### Body

Depending on the length of your literature review, you might want to divide the body into **subsections**. You can use a [subheading](https://www.scribbr.com/apa-style/apa-headings/) for each theme, time period, or methodological approach.

As you write, you can follow these tips:

* **[Summarize](https://www.scribbr.com/citing-sources/how-to-summarize/) and synthesize:** give an overview of the main points of each source and combine them into a coherent whole
* **Analyze and interpret:** don’t just [paraphrase](https://www.scribbr.com/citing-sources/how-to-paraphrase/) other researchers—add your own interpretations where possible, discussing the significance of findings in relation to the literature as a whole
* **Critically evaluate:** mention the strengths and weaknesses of your sources
* **Write in well-structured paragraphs:** use [transition words](https://www.scribbr.com/academic-writing/transition-words/) and [topic sentences](https://www.scribbr.com/research-paper/topic-sentences/) to draw connections, comparisons and contrasts

### Conclusion

In the conclusion, you should summarize the key findings you have taken from the literature and emphasize their significance.

> Dissertation literature review
> If the literature review is part of your thesis or dissertation, show how your research addresses gaps and contributes new knowledge, or discuss how you have drawn on existing theories and methods to build a framework for your research.
>
> Stand-alone literature review
> If you are writing a stand-alone paper, you can discuss the overall implications of the literature or make suggestions for future research based on the gaps you have identified.

When you’ve finished writing and revising your literature review, don’t forget to proofread thoroughly before submitting.
