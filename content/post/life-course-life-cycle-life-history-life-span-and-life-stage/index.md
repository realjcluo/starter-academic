Life course means: (1) Events marking transitions and trajectories of roles extending across the life span, such as entering and leaving school, acquiring a full-time job, getting married, divorced, having children, retiring, and the like; (2) a perspective on the investigation of the changing environment of the individual and its developmental implications; (3) an approach offering a way of linking early life experiences to later life outcomes, such as the exposure to early life risk factors and their consequences for later life health.

Life cycle means: (1) In biology, the term refers to the continuous and irreversible sequence of changes undergone by an organism from one primary form, as a gamete, to the development of the same form again. (2) In sociology, the term refers to a series of stages, across the life span, such as childhood and middle age, which are socially constructed and characterize the course of existence of an individual.

Life history means: (1) In biology, the term refers to the series of living phenomena exhibited by an organism in the course of development from inception to death. (2) In sociology, the term refers to chronology of events and activities that characterize a life.

Life span means: (1) The temporal focus of inquiry, for example, from conception to death; (2) the longevity of an individual; (3) the longest period over which the life of any organism or species may extend according to the available biological knowledge concerning it. Life span development then are the Multidimensional and multidirectional processes of growth involving both gains and losses, embedded in multilayered social and cultural contexts, involving dynamic processes of interaction of the developing organism with the social and physical environment.

A life stage is a phase in a sequence of age-graded statuses and/or roles, for example, childhood, adolescence, or old age. Finally, the life trajectory consists of sequences of roles and experiences over the life span defined by transitions or changes in statuses or life stages.
