I am a PhD student in Epidemiology and Public Health at University College London. My research interests revolve around disability and social relationships in later life. I also work with the ESRC International Centre For Lifecourse Studies in Society and Health (ICLS). I am interested in developing a career that combines teaching and research, while maintaining my interest in public engagement on ageing into disability.
